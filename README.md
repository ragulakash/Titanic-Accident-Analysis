Overview
This project is an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of the Titanic accident dataset, which contains information on the passengers aboard the Titanic. The goal is to explore the data, uncover patterns, and identify factors that influenced survival rates.

The dataset is widely known and is available through Kaggle and other sources. The project demonstrates how EDA can be used to extract insights and support decision-making, especially in understanding the characteristics that played a role in passenger survival.

Dataset
Source: Kaggle Titanic Dataset

Objectives
Analyze the data to understand:
What factors affected survival rates.
The distribution of passengers based on various features (age, gender, class, etc.).
Correlations between different variables (e.g., fare, age, gender) and survival.
Visualize trends and relationships in the data.

Analysis
The analysis focuses on the following aspects:

Data Cleaning:

Handling missing values, especially in Age, Cabin, and Embarked.
Transforming categorical variables like Sex and Embarked into numeric values.
Data Exploration:

Summary statistics and insights into each feature.
Correlations between survival and other factors (age, class, fare, etc.).
Visualization of the distribution of passengers across categories.
Key Insights:

Survival Rate: General survival rate and survival rate by gender, class, and age.
Gender: Females had a higher survival rate compared to males.
Passenger Class: Higher-class passengers (1st class) had a better chance of survival.
Age: Younger passengers had a slightly better chance of survival.
Visualizations:

Bar charts for survival rate by gender and class.
Histograms for age distribution.
Heatmaps for correlation analysis.
